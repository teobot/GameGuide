Sure, Supergirl has arguably been affected more in terms of the overall status quo, but that series was already on solid footing before the crossover. It\'s not so much that life in Gotham City has drastically changed in this new Earth-Prime era, but that Batwoman has used the foundation of Crisis to address its greatest recurring flaw.\r\nIf Alice has been the regular weak link in the Season 1 formula, she\'s a whole lot better off thanks to these most recent two installments. \"An Un-Birthday Present\" and now \"Take Your Choice\" have gone a long way toward humanizing this villain (a process previously reserved for the flashback scenes) and giving her a clearer and more understandable set of motivations. The series has quickly managed to flip the script on the new status quo established in the midseason finale.

Well, what’s terrible news for many is awesome for Zombie Army 4: Dead War, which couldn’t have hoped for better timing. It’s here to follow in those four-player co-op footsteps – except its zombies are also Nazis, and sometimes when you kill them you get a super-gross slow-mo kill. It definitely scratches the itch, though the handful of new ideas it injects don’t really reinvigorate the genre that Bill, Coach, Zoey, and Francis built.\r\n\r\nIt may feel overall familiar, but Zombie Army 4 does manage to separate itself from the already sizable horde of cooperative zombie shooters in a few enjoyable ways. For starters, the story is delightfully absurd, with occult forces bringing the Nazi army back from the dead, seemingly from the literal bowels of Hell. Its roughly eight-hour campaign ends with a ridiculous and surprising final confrontation that is worth seeing unspoiled. A simplified Horde mode exists as well, if you just want to stick to one location and see how many waves you can take on while experimenting with different weapons. I prefer the variety and forward momentum of playing the full campaign, but Horde offers plenty of opportunity for intense shootouts and last-second victories.\r\n\r\nShare\r\nAutoplay setting: On\r\nThe alternate-WW2 setting is disgusting and full of gore, but in a creative way where I was eager to see what I would be fighting next. I enjoyed confronting powerful enemies like flamethrower zombies with explosive gas tanks on their backs, zombie Nazi generals whose hearts must be removed in order to prevent them from spawning more enemies, and bosses like tanks that reveal giant ribcages when their armored sides are blown off. And it\'s made all the more exciting by an excellent soundtrack that feels like it comes straight out of the 1985 George A. Romero zombie film classic, Day of the Dead – my only complaint about the music being I wish it were mixed louder and piped in more often.\r\nThere\'s a layer of strategic dismemberment to the mindless slaughter.\r\n“\r\nThere’s a little more to it than running and gunning because the way you shoot zombies encourages you to confront the walking dead in a more nuanced way: Getting a certain number of kills unlocks special abilities, like overpowered sniper shots or hyper-fast shotgun reloading, but you also get a chance to recover health by pulling off up-close kills. Killing a certain number of zombies from a distance to earn the right to run in and recover some health adds a layer of strategic dismemberment to the mindless slaughter.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, there’s clearly some Doom inspiration here that helps keep the action moving, with certain zombies offering up ammo, grenades, or health packs if you stomp them after they’ve been defeated. This led to some great moments where I recovered from being cornered by taking out a huge wave, healed myself with up-close fatalities, and then stomped enemies on the ground to recover ammo before rushing toward the next objective. Where it had seemed like I was done for just moments earlier, I found myself maxed out and ready for whatever came next without so much as an ammo cache pitstop.', 7);

Almost every location in this surreal adventure game could be printed out and framed on the wall as a work of art all its own, but it’s the strange and twisting story that fans have been following for nearly seven years that ties them all together. That mystical story can feel appropriately mysterious at times and confusingly arbitrary at others, but it’s a heartwarming journey I’m very glad to have taken.\r\n\r\nKentucky Route Zero is ostensibly a point-and-click adventure game, but to call it that can be misleading. It’s only tangentially in the same realm as classics like Monkey Island or Grim Fandango, replacing item collection and puzzle solving with reams of intimate dialogue and an impressive amount of choice in how your characters navigate every conversation.\r\n\r\n\r\n40 of My Favorite Screenshots From Kentucky Route Zero (Visual Spoilers!)\r\n\r\nAct 1\r\n\r\nAct 1\r\n40 IMAGES\r\n\r\nAct 1\r\n\r\nInterlude 1\r\n\r\nAct 2\r\n\r\nAct 2\r\nYou begin Act 1 as Conway, a delivery truck driver trying to get to an address that seemingly doesn’t exist on any map, apparently only accessible through a peculiar hidden highway called the Zero. While that simple delivery goal is your motivation through Kentucky Route Zero’s five acts, Conway slowly accumulates companions along the way, each an interesting character in their own right. Their presence lets you further shape the conversations they are faced with.\r\n\r\nThrough the Eyes of Another\r\nOne of my favorite things about Kentucky Route Zero is how frequently it shakes up the way its dialogue is delivered, constantly adding to its bag of tricks. Some scenes may be straightforward conversations from a classic point-and-click side view, while others are entirely from the perspective of security guards watching your characters through security footage and discussing the scene in the past tense.\r\n\r\nTwo of my favorite scenes include an Interlude between Acts 2 and 3 where you’re watching a play from the perspective of a silent actor on stage, and another later on where you control a cat as they run around and listen to your characters’ conversations instead of moving those characters directly. Since Kentucky Route Zero is almost entirely about finding and then clicking through dialogue options, this endless creativity is a vital reason the roughly eight hours it took me to reach the credits stayed fresh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat said, things certainly start simpler, with the creative storytelling increasing greatly as the campaign progresses. While Kentucky Route Zero was initially released episodically, I had never played any of it until now, and the age of its first acts is abundantly clear. Act 1 and 2 were released in 2013, and their presentation and structure can pale in comparison to the latter acts at – especially when played in 2020 after games like Night in the Woods, which clearly took a page out of this book. (It also doesn’t help that Conway’s leg is broken for most of both acts, causing you to move at a frustratingly slow pace.)', 8);

It is, however, a decent game, albeit one that isn’t exactly dazzlingly different to the equally decent pair of Supercross games Milestone already released in 2019 and 2018. It’s very much another lap on the same rutted course.\r\n\r\nShare\r\nAutoplay setting: On\r\nFollowing in the wake of its four-wheeled peers carving out yearly cadences that deliver authentic, licensed motorsport experiences – like F1 and WRC – Supercross 3 is an earnest and competent crack at capturing the atmosphere of the motorbikes, ’Murica, n’ Monster Energy-fuelled tone of the AMA Supercross Championship. Hey: if travelling back and forth across the United States trying not to fall over sounds appealing to you, but you don’t have the patience for Death Stranding, maybe this is more your speed. Somewhere, somehow, Norman Reedus’ trousers are tingling, either way.\r\nBack in the Saddle\r\nThe fast pace and sense of speed is actually one of Supercross 3’s best assets, and I admire its ability to make even modest velocities seem blistering and dangerous in the cramped, stadium-style circuits – shoulder to shoulder with up to two dozen other riders. There’s something about how the ground whips by and riders’ clothing furiously flaps on their backs as the competitors slice through the air that really sells this.\r\n\r\nOf course, returning fans will know this minor graphical flourish has been a feature of developer Milestone’s Supercross series since the franchise debuted in 2018, and it’s one of many that go all the way down from the track editor to what seems to be the same range of butt patches.\r\nWhile it’s straightforward to pick up the learning curve is steep.\r\n“\r\nThat said, there are some differences here that distinguish Supercross 3 from Supercross 2 beyond the token changes to the HUD. First and foremost is the tweaked bike handling. Bikes feel more connected to the ground than in previous editions, which had a bit of a floaty feel to the back wheel, but the difference doesn’t seem hugely staggering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9 IMAGES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRacing remains fairly accessible because there are still two handling settings – standard and realistic. Standard dulls the sense of side-to-side inertia a bit and realistic challenges you to take full control of weight shifting, but there isn’t really a massive gulf between the two. However, while it’s straightforward to pick up the learning curve is steep and, like the past two games, regardless of the handling mode it’s hard to ever quite know what will cause a bail. It’s pretty forgiving if you mess up a rhythm section and case a jump (or three, or four; botch one landing and it tends to doom you to several more ugly jumps and spine-rattling landings) but the barest brush of a trackside tuff block is still regularly enough to send you cartwheeling into oblivion. Try to scrub a jump too late and you may also find yourself pitching into weird mid-air twists that seem to unleash a ferocious fart in the face of physics. There are rewards for not using rewinds during races, but I don’t earn them much.\r\nWhoops, I Did It Again\r\nIt doesn’t help that the tutorial can barely be classified as such. It tells players how to start and then just… lists the buttons on screen while a race unfolds, without any further instructions on how to do anything else. A basic history with motorcycle games is probably enough to be able to pick up Supercross 3, keep yourself pointed in the right direction, and accidentally teach yourself how to seat bounce, but it seems odd it doesn’t really make much of an effort to teach players the real nuances of its bike handling dynamics. A deeper dive into the necessary techniques to tackle tracks is buried beneath a bunch of menu shuffling in Challenge Mode, but I found free riding around the open-world compound area allows for experimentation and practice with far less rigid constraints.\r\n\r\nI’ve wrung plenty of fun out of Supercross 3 since coming to grips with the handling, however. Nailing a perfect holeshot in the frantic blitz to the first corner or skipping over a series of whoops without losing momentum is very satisfying; you’ve just got to work for it. The 450s are my highlight, and easily the most fun to ride. The increased power allows you to step out the rear, turn harder, and jump further.\r\n\r\nThe other notable new features are that you can now join official teams in career mode and, for the first time in the series, you can play as female riders. They don’t look any better than the blokes, who aren’t exactly up to 2020 standards themselves, but it’s good to finally recognise that women can, in fact, ride bikes.\r\nVerdict\r\nDeceptively technical and tricky to master, Monster Energy Supercross 3 is a modest but solid two-wheeled racer with good atmosphere and a great sense of speed. However, the fact the previous two are largely just as good makes it harder to get the heart rate up again, whether exceeding the maximum safe daily dose of Monster or not.', 8);
INSERT INTO `reviews` VALUES (5, 'https://www.roadtovr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1.-TWD_SNS_Keyart_GameplayReveal_2019.jpg', 'The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners Review', 'A rotten good time.\r\n', 'Theo Clapperton', '2020-02-19 01:01:49', 'Imagine what would happen if you took a half-season of The Walking Dead TV show, mashed it together with a Deus Ex or System Shock style of exploration and decision-making, and then drizzled it with the best aspects of a modern VR game. What you might end up with is a survival horror game that’s oppressively tense and brutal, but also tugs on you relentlessly to explore every corner of its post-apocalyptic world for hidden loot and nuggets of lore. The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners is exactly that, and it absolutely nails the mix, delivering it with a level of detail and a depth of interactivity that feels like a genuine step forward for virtual reality.\r\n\r\nYou play as the Tourist, a storied survivor and living urban legend who seems to be immune to the fictional virus that makes everybody else a little bitier in The Walking Dead universe. You’ve rolled into the sunken remains of New Orleans following a rumor about a buried hotbed of limitless supplies called the Reserve, and the rest is up to you. It’s a simple setup, but one that\'s perfect for the size and scope of Saints & Sinners because it doesn’t immediately saddle you with any presumptions about your character’s morality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9 IMAGES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou’re introduced to New Orleans by your old buddy Henri, but the moral choices you’ll make while navigating its several open-ended zones are yours alone. As an Obsidian fan, I was pleased to find that there were several major factions fighting for control of the Reserve, each with their own perspective on the bleak situation around you. One such moral choice involves a mission where a faction member will send you to rescue their brother in exchange for an important item, and it’s fantastic that you can then choose to upend the original mission and kill the brother, earning his captors as allies and instead taking the item by force – if that’s the path you prefer, of course. Saints & Sinners’ ending depends entirely on the decisions you make throughout the campaign too, few of which are decidedly ‘good’ or ‘evil’.\r\n\r\nAll that choice makes the Tourist primarily a shell for you to insert your own personality into, with decent voice acting that gives life to each dialogue option, much like Commander Shepard in the Mass Effect series. By comparison, Telltale’s The Walking Dead accomplished some truly great feats of cinematic storytelling and meaningful decision-making in its hostile and zombie-riddled world, but it never gave me free rein to do whatever I wanted. That’s something I had craved for years when I was a regular watcher of The Walking Dead TV series, and while Telltale’s take on The Walking Dead certainly made me care about Clementine, it never made me feel like I was in that world.\r\n\r\nSaints & Sinners scratches the itch for a truly explorable Walking Dead world with the grace and confidence of a well-lubricated bowie knife.\r\n“\r\nSaints & Sinners scratches that itch with the grace and confidence of a well-lubricated bowie knife. The portrayal of killing zombies – or walkers – has never been as satisfying as it is here, and the abject terror of an unexpected walker swarm has never been as palpable. Zombie guts and brains are rendered with great detail, but what really grounds you in this world is the fact that weapons have appropriate weight and heft. Heavy weapons like axes and rifles require you to grip them with both hands for stability, while small weapons like shivs are much lighter and easier to land precise blows with. It’s not as nuanced as a game like Boneworks; you can’t wield just any item as a weapon, but this combat system is far more tactile and exciting than if you were doing it remotely with a gamepad or a keyboard.\r\n\r\nDiseased walkers explode and unleash poisonous gases that lower your health pool when killed up close, meanwhile helmeted walkers are far tougher to kill, requiring a complete decapitation or extremely precise blows to exposed parts of their heads. This increased challenge only adds to the intensity of fighting an entire pack of walkers at once, a common occurrence later on, as you need to quickly pick and choose which walkers need to be killed in which way and in which order to preserve the durability of your best weapons. Rapidly juggling my inventory in real-time to acclimate to each fight forced me to be smarter and, as a result, Saints & Sinners never fell into that Action-RPG trap of becoming repetitive. I spent a little over 18 hours in the campaign – the story itself is a few hours shorter than that, but it was just loads of fun to complete scavenging runs and hunt for secret recipes on my own.\r\n\r\n\r\nShare\r\nAutoplay setting: On\r\nThe walkers and human NPCs themselves have their own agendas too, often interacting with one another in interesting and useful ways. While the AI isn’t always the most bright, causing enemies to sometimes get stuck in hilarious and vulnerable positions, an impressive amount of the unfurling drama that makes Saints & Sinners exciting is simulated in real-time rather than deliberately scripted. To my satisfaction, I found that many of the quests allowed me to choose my own path to a solution, and it was a delight to discover alternate routes and secrets, even if the map can feel a little nondescript or claustrophobic at times. Even when I was presented with straightforward options for moving through a group of wary human NPCs or solving a quest with diplomacy – or simply by attacking an NPC directly – I could just as easily avoid interacting with certain characters altogether, either by attracting a herd of walkers and sneaking past the ensuing carnage, or by climbing over the side of a wall or up the side of a house. That freedom to tackle a situation so many different ways is fantastic.\r\n\r\nAnd though the bigger story about breaking into the Reserve can sometimes feel pretty thin between long periods of exploring, looting, killing, and crafting my way through the streets of New Orleans, it was refreshing for a VR game to let me define my character through my own decisions in a setting as meticulously detailed and open-ended as this. While Saints & Sinners isn’t exactly the first of its kind, this caliber of storytelling reaches a height that VR had otherwise yet to achieve.\r\n\r\nZombalaya\r\nCentral to the tension of Saints & Sinners is that you only get so much time each day to do things before the city’s bells are rung and the streets flood with ravenous corpses. Once you head back to safety you can go to sleep and skip to the next morning, but the number of undead you encounter the following day increases. This creates a compelling risk-reward choice between pushing your luck past dark or playing it safe at the cost of worse odds tomorrow, driving the tension of the entire game.\r\n\r\n\r\nShare\r\nAutoplay setting: On\r\nThat dilemma would be perfectly manageable if not for the fact that you only have a limited amount of inventory space, pushing you to think more carefully about what you grab. You also have to continue crafting or finding new weapons as your old ones tend to fall apart at a distressingly high rate. That forces you to make each attack count, which is easier said than done since you actually have to swing and aim with your real-world appendages. With a ticking clock looming behind all that, Saints & Sinners quickly becomes the perfect storm for adrenaline junkies.\r\n\r\nLuckily, the inventory management is intuitive and feels great. Picking up items and placing them into your backpack is as simple as throwing them over your shoulder, and to access them again you simply grab the pack off of your back and pull items out of their neatly arranged slots. Meanwhile, weapons can be holstered in convenient slots on your waist and back while your journal and flashlight fit snugly on your chest. This style of physical inventory management has existed in VR games like Rec Room and Township Tale for some time, and it’s far more interactive and interesting than simply tapping on a menu screen with your fingers or pointing at some text with a laser pointer.', 9);
